# Zig Utilities

A collection of utility scripts and tools I use for zig

## `scripts` folder

The `scripts` folder contains utility bash scripts used for building/updating zig

## `tools` folder

The `tools` folder contains different submodules of tools for things such as:

* package management (zigmod)
* intellisense/suggestions (zls)
* building everything (zig-bootstrap)
